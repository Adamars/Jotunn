# Transitioning from JotunnLib

When switching from JotunnLib to the new combined Jotunn library, you'll find that most things have remained similar, but are just renamed or used _slightly_ differently.  

The notable changes between JotunnLib and the new Jotunn are:
- [VS project setup & dependencies](vs-project.md)
- [Renamed managers & methods](renaming.md)
- [Register events have been removed](register-events.md)
- [The process for adding prefabs and interacting with the PrefabManager](prefabs.md)
- [A larger focus on using assets created in Unity](assets.md)

A few of the more minor changes between JotunnLib and the new Jotunn are:
- _ReflectionUtils_ has been renamed to _ReflectionHelper_

In addition, there are a whole bunch of new features added, such as support for custom status effects, custom UI, and loading recipes from JSON. Check out the [tutorials](../../tutorials/overview.md) section to see how to do all of these and more.
