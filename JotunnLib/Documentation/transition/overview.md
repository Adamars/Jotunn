# Transitioning
If you are looking to add the Jötunn dependency to an existing project, please consider reading through our [Jötunn Quickstart](../home/quickstart.md).

If you're switching from an existing library to Jötunn, take a look through the following guide based on which library you're coming from:
- [JotunnLib](jotunnlib/overview.md)
- [ValheimLib](valheimlib/overview.md)
- [SkillInjector](skillinjector/overview.md)

Additionally, check out the [tutorials](../home/tutorials/overview.md) page to get a better idea how to use Jötunn!
