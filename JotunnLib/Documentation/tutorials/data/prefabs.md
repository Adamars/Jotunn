# Registering custom prefabs
_Prefabs_ in Valheim are objects that can be instantied and used within the world. This includes everything from inventory items, placeable items (Pieces), entities, etc.  

_Note: In order to create Pieces, Inventory items, Vegetation, or nearly anything, it **must** have a prefab created first._
