# Introduction
This section will contain tutorials on how to use the various parts of the framework to do things such as:
- Using the [ModStub]() template to create the [ExampleMod]()
- Creating [custom prefabs]()
- Creating [custom items]()
- Creating [custom recipes]()
- Creating [custom skills]()
- Creating [custom pieces]() (buildable items)
- Using [mocks]() inside of AssetBundles to reference native assets
- etc.

Everything that you interact with will be through the various [managers](xref:JotunnLib.Managers), most of which will be Singletons that can be accessed through their `Instance` property.

For information on how to setup a mod with JotunnLib, see [Getting started](getting-started.md). To start creating custom items, take a look at [Custom data](data/overview.md).
