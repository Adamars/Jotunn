# Events
This section will show how to register custom handlers for in-game events.

_Note: Not many events are implemented yet, but more will be added as development continues._

## Registering a handler
To register a handler for an event, we use the [EventManager](xref:JotunnLib.Managers.EventManager) singleton class.  
All event args for existing events can be found within the [JotunnLib.Events](xref:JotunnLib.Events) namespace.
