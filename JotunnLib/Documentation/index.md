# Jötunn, the Valheim Library
Jötunn provides entity abstractions and manager interfaces to facilitate developer workflow when modding valheim. This project's intention is to reduce both complexity and plugin interoperability issues, allowing the developer to focus on being creative rather than solving implementation issues.

## Source code
The source code for JotunnLib (and the accompanying test/demo mod) is available on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Jotunnb) 

## Tutorials
This section contains tutorials on how to get started with using JotunnLib, and how to create a basic mod. View it [here](tutorials/intro.md)

_note: the tutorial uses the [Mod Stub](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModStub) to work towards creating the final [Example mod](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnExampleMod)._

## Conceptual
This section contains information about how Valheim itself works, as well as how JotunnLib interfaces with the game. There likely will not be many code examples here, but rather high level overviews of how various systems work. View it [here](conceptual/intro.md) 

## API Documentation
This section contains documentation on all of the public code within JotunnLib. View it [here](xref:JotunnLib)
