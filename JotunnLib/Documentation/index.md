# Jötunn, the Valheim Library

Jötunn (/ˈjɔːtʊn/, "giant"), the Valheim Library was created with the intent to facilitate developer creativity, unify the communities problem solving efforts, and enhance developer productivity by curating a library of common helper utilities, as well as interfaces and abstractions which aid with mod interoperability and networked gameplay consistency.

We have lots of features planned for the future, and did hold back on what we wanted to release with so that we could focus on house keeping post-merger, however I hope the features we have implemented thus far prove to be a useful base and provide an idea of the consistency we aim to deliver moving forwards.

## Source code
The source code for Jötunn (and the accompanying test/demo mod) is available on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding) 

## Tutorials
This section contains tutorials on how to get started with using JötunnLib, and how to create a basic mod. View it [here](tutorials/intro.md)

_note: the tutorial uses the [Mod Stub](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModStub) to work towards creating the final [Example mod](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModExample)._

## Conceptual
This section contains information about how Valheim itself works, as well as how JötunnLib interfaces with the game. There likely will not be many code examples here, but rather high level overviews of how various systems work. View it [here](conceptual/intro.md) 

## API Documentation
This section contains documentation on all of the public code within JötunnLib. View it [here](xref:Jotunn)
